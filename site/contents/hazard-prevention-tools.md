# Tools for preventing Data Hazards


Many researchers, companies and communities are working hard to develop tools 
that can help make data science research and development safer. 

This page is an opportunity to signpost to those projects and tools we know of that 
might help those looking for ways to implement safety precautions in their work
to prevent Data Hazards. 

Inclusion in this list is not necessarily an endorsement or recommendation, 
but an opportunity for ideas and for readers to find out about new projects 
that might be relevant to them. 

If you have a tool to add to this list, please submit a pull request with the
relevant template, or if you don't use GitHub please send us an email.
